Wait, another?
--------------

Yes, another. It's the third one, actually.

-------------
The first one
-------------

There's a `reddit post`_ of the this one, featuring:

- No lining.
- Internal divisions/pockets made of lycra.

- Velcros in the wrong orientation.

- Elastic loops on the outside for my hugely inadequate pump

- Loops to pass a belt through.
- U-lock holder.

How I made it
-------------
I tried to make something similar to this `old edition of roadrunner's hip bag`_ (video).

Delfi helped me to do diagrams for the pattern in paper, and then translate them into a sketch (with proper measures) and then, finally, into fabric.

BTW, aren't her drawings super cute? you can follow `her instagram`_ for more extra-cute content!

What I've learned
-----------------
- The horizontal velcro piece should be on the flap for more adjustability. This one really can't be closed tight when it's empty ðŸ˜­.
- I need a smaller hand pump (not sewing-related, tho). It's also a real pain to get to even 100psi with that one.
- I don't really want to carry my U-lock in my hip.
- Having both the belt loops in the back and the back piece reaching around to the front one to add thickness to the bag makes the U-lock stay in place securely, but the actual bag stays pretty loose.
    - Another side effect of this construction is, the bottom has effectively zero thickness, making the bag wegde-shaped, with the wide part at the top and a rather pronounced angle. When you open it, it kind of feels like everything inside is gonna fall.

--------------
Second attempt
--------------

I made an attempt at lining, now with more kinds of fabric at my disposal.

I also tried to make the bag fit more snugly and have a less pronounced wedge shape.
Now the bottom of the bag has some depth to it, and there's less of a difference in witdth in the high vs low parts of the back piece, making the wedge less pronounced.

I made some sketches on a 2:1 scale and modified the patterns from the previous attempt:

.. image:: {static}/i-made-another-hip-pack/v2-patterns.jpg

Now there's no U-lock holder, and the belt loops are closer to the bag's sides.

.. image:: {static}/i-made-another-hip-pack/v2-back-floor.jpg

I'm pretty happy with how easy is to pass a carabiner through that loop.

.. image:: {static}/i-made-another-hip-pack/v2-front-floor.jpg

BUT here's where I fucked up:

I sewed the lining the wrong way ðŸ¤¦, making the seams visible (and they aren't pretty).
Also, that particular fabric's rather prone to fraying, so it'll be more of a 'learning experience' bag than a 'use regularly' one.

.. image:: {static}/i-made-another-hip-pack/v2-fucked-lining.jpg

It does have a more snug fit, but the belt loops tend to get closer to each other making the bag sag a little

.. image:: {static}/i-made-another-hip-pack/v2-on-me-closed.jpg

Oh, and I tried to have some form of divisions/internal pockets:

.. image:: {static}/i-made-another-hip-pack/v2-on-me-open.jpg

It however ended up feeling too flimsy, and when pushing things deeper into the bag on either side of the division, it would strech downwards and get in the way.
I might try sewing the liner to the exterior of the bag on a few spots in the future, that might cause the liner to feel stiffer.

What I learned
--------------
- If I want to achieve a bag that truly feels one with my hip, belt loops are not gonna cut it. 
- With belt loops, the effective thickness at the top of the bag will always be the distance between the loop and the seam with the front panel.
    - Because of this, I tried a different approach in the next version.
- Having the liner fabric as an internal division didn't feel good.
    - I tried a different approach in the next version for this as well.
- Perhaps the liner fabric is better fitted for a French seam?

--------------------------------------
And finally, my most recent invention!
--------------------------------------
This bag features it's own strap which is affixed to the front panel at a sightly upwards angle, so the weight of the bag itself tightens it to the body, and the tension from the strap compresses the bag.

I did not invent this, obviously. I figured it out by closely looking at `crome industries' citizen bag`_
