The problem

You know this thing, youtube, right?

Let's suppose I want to see some videos about `dwm`_.

The first two seem interesting and I want to see them. The third one doesn't catch my attention and I've seen the fourth one already.

Let's go through my options. I could:

- Open any of the two, watch it, then go back on my browser and open the other one.

- Open both of them on new tabs, watch one of them, and then go to the remaining tab to watch the other one.

Both of them are not ideal. I want to make the decision of watching the first two videos (and not the third one) now, and then be free to get my hands full of popcorn butter or whatever.
I usually don't mind getting my hands dirty, but getting them clean just to switch tabs annoys me, more so when it __feels__ like it could be avoided.

If I had to choose between these two, I would probably go for the latter, since it is rarely the case that I want to check out only two videos, and this approach scales better since I can open many tabs at once (with 16GB of RAM, I can have like six open at the same time).

Otherwise I would have to go back to the search page, remember what it is that I wanted to see, hope that the result didn't change when doing the search for the second time, and open it.

The solution

What I needed was some sort of playlist or queue. Add all the videos that I wanted to see __somewhere__ and then play
